The files are to simulate an ultrasound ranging system.
Every atomic model has its test.
The system also has a test to varify its function.

Order of tests:
1. Model:MyReceiver 
   model file:ReceiverTest.ma
   event file:ReceiverTest.ev  
2. Model:MyTimer
   model file:TimerTest.ma
   event file:TimerTest.ev 
3. Model:MyTransmitter 
   model file:MyTransmitter.ma
   event file:MyTransmitter.ev 
4. Model:MyProcessor 
   model file:MyProcessor.ma
   event file:MyProcessor.ev 
5. Model:System 
   model file:SystemTest.ma
   event file:SystemTest.ev
